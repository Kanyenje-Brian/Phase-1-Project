VANGUARD LTD. AIRCRAFT INSIGHT
Vanguard, a Business Conglomerate, is interested in expanding its portfolio and has set its scope on purchasing and operating planes for both private and commercial enterprises. However, with no prior experience in the aviation sector, the company needs guidance on which airplanes to invest on as diffrerent airplanes pose different risk factors. In order to provide guidance to the company, intensive research on different airplane data will be done in order to generate insight on which airplanes pose the lowest risks. The insight will be used by the head of the new aviation division in deciding on which airplanes to purchase and operate.
